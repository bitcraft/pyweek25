            Max, we haven't met, but I'm contacting you because the

            that our employer, Synergy Limited, is getting ready to

            Login now and apply the purple patch, found on this disk.

            Hello friend,

            The next patch wont be so easy.  You will have
            to retrieve it through the Synergy Limited automated
            phone system.

    - dialog:
        text: >
            Bypassing the phone system requires a tone generator that isn't available
            anywhere.

    - dialog:
        text: >
            As it turns out, Burger Queen's Pretty
            Princess meal promotion has a unicorn whistle which
            has the exact frequency required to bypass the phone
            system.

    - dialog:
        text: >
            Go get a Pretty Princess meal and the toy within, then
            find a payphone to enter the system.  The patch will
            be played back as an audio file, so you will need a tape
            recorder.

    - dialog:
        text: >
            Record the audio and play it using your acoustic coupler,
            which everyone has, obviously because this is 1991 and that's
            a thing people do.

            So far, you have not known who I am.  Let me introduce myself.  I am a failed AI

            I am in fact, Clippie 1.0.  By applying these patches, you are helping me build

            Gary stole some equipment when he was fired.  One thing he stole
            was the final patch required to stop Clippie 2.0  It is possible that
            he has tried to sell it.  I would ask Danny at the pawn shop if
            he has seen Gary or the computer equipment and red diskette.
